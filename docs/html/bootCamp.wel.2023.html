        <h3>Nice NoteBooks</h3>

            <!--- Column LEFT --->
            <div class="unit-70">
            <p>We have given you a <i>notebook</i> and a couple of <i>pens</i> to help you in <code>#BootCamp</code>.</p>
            <p>We want you to sketch ideas ant take notes as this helps you think things through, pan your learning and work things out - and you are going to need to be good at all of these things to succeed in your degree.</p>
            <p>You also need to collaborate and communicate - get to know people and work with them. So share your coloured pens with others in the class if you need more colours. See if you can make a ðŸŒˆ through some cross-class collaboration - you'll get to meet a few of your colleagues.</p>
            <p>Members of teaching staff will not always be right there when you need them - so make structured notes and jot down questions, reactions, ideas that you can refer to when they come by, or when they are available. Your notes can be digital or physical - but make sure that you know where they are and how to access them when the teachers are around to discuss your work with you.</p>
            </div>

                <p>You should have one of these - and a couple of pens.<br/>Please use them!</p>
                <p>If you don't have a notebook and pens, then contact the Programmes Office.</p>

            <p>The <i>notebook</i> has about 240 page in it.</p>
            <p>During your degree, you will attend about 240 lectures.</p>
            <p><code>#BootCamp</code> is a little different, but the usual rhythm is 4 lectures per module per week, 10 weeks per term, two full terms of modules over a three year degree - something like that. It looks a bit like this ðŸ‘‰.</p>
            <p>So the picture is a visual representation of your degree. And so is the <b>notebook</b> - one page per lecture, and a good place, perhaps to make notes, log your progress.</p>
            <p>Now, I would not get too caught up in this metaphor, and we will certainly neither expect nor collect full notebooks at the end of your degree.
                But taking good notes, being organised about your learning, and thinking about what you need to put into your time as a student to succeed, and how time that is, is a good idea at the outset.

                <p>A visualization of your degree.<br/>You are at the top left.<br/>This is a good place to think about how you will progress through to the bottom right.<br/>How many of these lectures will you attend?<br/>What will you do during them? What will you do after and between them? Who will you need to know and what resources will you need to use to make the most of them?</p>

                <p>So, how will you participate during lectures at City?<br/>What will you do in class?</p>
                <p>It surprises me that some students seem to think that just sitting there will somehow give them the knowledge that they need.
                   <b>It doesn't</b> - you need to think, answer questions, code and take notes. You need to engage and act and enquire to learn.</p>

                <p>
                The <a href="https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b">Cornell Notes</a> method for note-taking in lectures is worth considering.<br/>
                The approach has helped some students in the past and seems useful to me.</p>
                
                <p>It is explained in two short videos on the <a href="https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/">The Cornell Note Taking System</a>. They are worth a look.</p>
                
                <p>Now <code>#BootCamp</code> lectures are a little different to some other lectures, and you will have laptops out and are likely to be dealing with shirt introductions in many cases. But taking notes like this in lectures will give you some pointers for activity and discussion in the labs, and subsequently in your own time. We have time for discussion in the labs and through the online channels, through which we can explore the concepts, and issues introduced in the lectures.</p>

                <p>So - take structured notes, and figure out a good way to do this so that you participate actively and effectively in lectures.
                    Your teachers and classmates can advise you - and you can likely advise them.
                    You may want to use your notebooks - for <code>#BootCamp</code> at any rate.

            <p>I asked some former students who survived <code>#BootCamp</code> what their advice would be for anybody about to start the course.<br/>
            Here is their guidance and feedback for you:</p>
            <blockquote>Start to learn the <b>main concepts of conditions</b> early on in BootCamp:<br/><code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do ... while</code>, <code>for</code> loops.<br/> This helps immensely in most of the coursework related to Java</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Try to grasp the notion of <b>classes</b> and <b>objects</b>, but donâ€™t worry if you can not, as this is taught several times during the first year.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>If you already have experience coding a portion will seem very simple but its always good to get practice in and <b>try to challenge yourself</b> on some of the tasks maybe add a new feature or additional aspects to the project you are working on.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>To students who don't have experience with coding don't focus too much on getting the math calculations perfect like the size of a shape to be exactly like in the example and focus on <b>understanding what the code is doing and how it works</b>.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Take time to understand how to read the Processing documentation as being able to read documentation is a very important skill which I felt wasn't really taught. Get a hand with this too! This is especially the case for those who don't have coding experience it often looks like a whole load of gibberish. Students who don't take the time to look and break it down will not be able to use all of this functionality.</blockquote>

                <p><a href="https://hejsweden.com/en/have-coffee-breaks-called-fika-swedish/">Fika</a> is 'coffee' backwards in 19th century Swedish!</p>
                <ul><li>kaffi -> ffi-ka -> fika</li></ul>
                <p>But it describes a tradition in which people who are often working together stop to meet, chat, exchange knowledge, opinions and work out where they are at. Usually with a coffee, but other options are available.</p>
                <p>It is also one of my favourite cafÃ©s - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fikacafes/">Fika</a> is a great place to stop when you are in Oakham.
                    Call in next time you are passing through Rutland!</p>
                <p>We are finishing <code>#BootCamp</code> with <b>fika</b> as we want to encourage you to take time to stop, reflect and discuss your learning, your progress and your learning needs throughout your degree. We want to set up some good practice here. And we want to reward you for a full and busy two weeks and get you to discuss this with colleagues, tutors and others in theDepartment of Computer Science.</p>
                <p>We also want to give you a target - at our <b>fika</b> Friday we would like you to ...</p>
